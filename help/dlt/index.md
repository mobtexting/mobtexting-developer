# DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY (DLT)

### Insights on New TRAI SMS Regulation Implementation

* Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is a digital system for keeping and managing the record of sender IDs and template.

### TRAI has introduced an advanced extension of the Block chain – Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to prevent spam Guidelines for Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for Enterprises

* Enterprises need to register with the Operator’s DLT platform by submitting necessary business documents. Enterprises need to select a Registered Telemarketer (RTM) and permit them to perform functions on their behalf.
* Enterprises need to acquire consent from consumers (mobile subscribers) through SMS, Web or Mobile App and upload them on the DLT platform.
* It is mandatory for any entity that intends to send a communication through messaging and voice gateway on the DLT platforms.
* Telemarketers and end-users have to register on the DLT platforms separately.
Header (Sender ID) registration: Messages are classified into promotional, transactional, service explicit and service implicit which are registered and every header gets a unique Header ID that is shared across other DLT platforms seamlessly. All headers and templates on the platform should be registered.
* Content Template Registration: Entities are required to register all their templates on the DLT system. Every template gets a unique Template ID that is shared across other DLT platforms uniformly.
* You can go to below Operator DLT Registration portals and select Sphere Edge Ltd
